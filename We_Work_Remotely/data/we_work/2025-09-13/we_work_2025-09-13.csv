60,Frontend Engineer,"Mobena is a three-person, remote-first startup building the “evolution” of multi-generational tax/estate planning software, targeting the advisors of America’s 2 million wealthiest families. We’re currently hiring our first dedicated UI Engineer to “own” the frontend of our flagship product, Mobena Evolution, for which we have little to no frontend code. You’ll work directly with our backend/algorithm-focused CTO, as well as our designer-founder, to turn evolving Figma concepts into fast, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces. What You’ll Do Choose and justify the frameworks and tools that best fit our needs. We have some holdover prototype code in Vite JS, but you can take it or leave it; all of our Figma concepts are new. The backend is a standard HTTP API. We are open to everything from established web stacks (React, Angular, Svelte, Vite) to cross-platform or native solutions (Qt, WASM, .NET MAUI, Tauri, Electron, Tk)—literally anything, if you can convince us it’s the right choice. Build our UI from the ground up, establishing clear, maintainable patterns for components, state management, styling, testing, performance, and accessibility. Collaborate to refine and sometimes re-frame existing screen designs in Figma. Connect the frontend to our APIs (REST, GraphQL, or similar). Lay groundwork for future mobile clients; however, experience in this regard is a plus rather than a requirement. About You You’ve shipped an interactive application—web, desktop, or mobile—via coursework, open source, side project or professional work. You care about usability and design quality. (That is, you care about the user.) You learn by doing: building things rather than sitting in committee. You are happy to say I don’t know. We try to cultivate “beginner’s mind” at Mobena—it helps us avoid conventional traps and groupthink. The first step of thinking like a beginner is acknowledging your own ignorance! 😊 You can defend your technical choices in clear English, and can take credit for your successes as well your mistakes. You are comfortable in an early-stage, collaborative environment.",https://www.weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/mobena-frontend-engineer,2025-05-16 20:03:34 UTC,2025-09-13 20:03:34 UTC,Front-End Programming,75000,75000,USD,Mobena,"New York, NY"

93,Product Manager - CRM Team,"This is a remote position. NuxGame is a leading technology company in the iGaming industry, providing innovative solutions that transform online gaming. Our platform powers operators with robust tools, ensuring seamless integrations and operations. We are embarking on a new project to build a cutting-edge CRM service that will revolutionize how operators engage with users, enabling personalized communication and dynamic user segmentation across multiple channels. We are seeking an experienced Product Manager to lead the development of a comprehensive CRM system. This role requires expertise in refactoring basic systems and creating scalable solutions from scratch. You will be responsible for the MVP design, creating a backlog, and expanding the team to build a fully integrated, API-driven service that can scale to meet the needs of our platform. The ideal candidate will have experience with journey builders , a deep understanding of handling complex multi-condition scenarios in the condition builder, and the ability to manage high-load messaging systems . You will work to build a highly scalable service integrated into the NuxGame platform. Requirements Key Responsibilities: Segmentation Service Development Refactor and Expand Segmentation Capabilities : Transform the platform’s basic segmentation system into a powerful, data-driven segmentation engine. The initial segmentation will be based on profile information, but you will expand it to include user behavior, geographic location, transactional history, and other data points, allowing operators to create detailed user segments for marketing and engagement purposes. Custom Segment Creation : Build a flexible interface to allow operators to create custom segments based on predefined criteria (e.g., user behavior such as frequent bettors, transactional history like large deposits, or GEO preferences). Real-Time Data Integration : Integrate the segmentation engine with the data warehouse (ClickHouse) to ensure real-time updates and data processing, continuously reflecting current user behavior and preferences. Personalized Content Delivery via CMS : Integrate the segmentation engine with the CMS to allow operators to display personalized content such as game recommendations, promotions, and payment methods. For example, users from different GEOs may see localized content, while high-value users can receive tailored offers. Condition Builder Implementation Flexible Condition Builder : Design a condition builder that allows operators to set up automated workflows and triggers based on user behavior, actions, and system events. The builder must support multi-condition workflows, allowing operators to define complex conditions such as ""if a user deposits over $500 and places three bets within an hour, trigger a high-value bonus."" Handling Complex Conditions and Corner Cases : Design the condition builder to handle various corner cases in multi-condition workflows, ensuring that the system remains stable under complex rules and high usage. Implement UX best practices to simplify condition setup for users, minimizing errors and reducing complexity. Backend and Frontend Event Integration : Ensure seamless integration of backend events (e.g., deposit actions, KYC updates) and frontend events (e.g., user clicks, page navigations) into the condition builder. These events will trigger personalized notifications, actions, and content delivery. Risk Management & Scalable Rule System : Implement a scalable rule system that can handle a large number of conditions without performance degradation. Proactively address potential risks and edge cases that may arise in complex, multi-condition workflows. Message Center Refactoring and Expansion Omnichannel Messaging Hub : Refactor the current message center into a robust omnichannel messaging hub, supporting multiple communication channels such as SMS, email, push notifications , and third-party services (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram). This will allow operators to engage users across their preferred channels. Event-Driven and Scheduled Messaging : Ensure the message center supports both event-driven and scheduled messaging, with capabilities to handle high-load scenarios. Build systems that can efficiently process real-time event-based notifications (e.g., transaction completions) and handle time-sensitive scheduled messages (e.g., promotions or reminders). High-Load Planning and Performance Optimization : Design the system to handle high loads, ensuring it can scale to support millions of users and high volumes of event-based notifications. Plan for peak usage scenarios, optimizing delivery times for both event-based and scheduled messages. Message Template Constructor : Build a dynamic template constructor to allow operators to create reusable message templates that support personalization through dynamic fields (e.g., user names, deposit amounts, or loyalty tier). Performance Tracking and Optimization : Develop performance tracking tools to monitor delivery rates, user engagement, and conversion metrics. Use these insights to optimize messaging strategies, ensuring high performance under all usage conditions. Team and Product Development Backlog Creation and MVP Definition : You will define the MVP for the CRM service and manage a detailed backlog, prioritizing key features such as segmentation, condition building, and messaging. The MVP should deliver immediate value while laying the groundwork for scalability. Team Expansion and Leadership : As the product evolves, you will expand the CRM team, working with backend and frontend developers, UX designers, and data engineers. You will manage cross-functional teams and ensure the roadmap aligns with business objectives.

99,CRO Man (Conversion Rate Optimization Specialist),"About Headlight Glasses We’re a one-product eCommerce brand built on Direct Response principles, helping American drivers see safely at night. Since launching on October 31st, 2022, we’ve generated over $3.4M in profitable revenue — almost entirely from Meta Ads — using only a basic Shopify landing page. We are not an unproven startup. We’re a profitable, scaling brand with massive room for CRO upside. With a landing page on the level of Hostage Tape, the ceiling is far higher. --- Your Mission We’ve built a $3.4M+ business with a basic Shopify page. Now, the mission is simple: Take Headlight Glasses to **$1M pre-tax net profit this season (Oct 1, 2025 – Feb 28, 2026).** If we hit that goal, you don’t just get profit share — you get a **$25,000 milestone bonus** on top. That $1M mark isn’t just a number, it’s our shared mission this grind season. - You will own the post-click experience: rebuilding the landing page, building advertorial pages, testing offers, increasing AOV. - I (the founder) will own the pre-click experience: creative and ad angles. - Together, we push until $1M pre-tax net profit is real. --- Workload & Seasonality Headlight Glasses is a seasonal brand. We sprint hard in winter, then scale down in summer. - Oct 1 – Dec 21: Full-time, ~48 hrs/week (6 days, Mon–Sat). - Dec 22 – Feb 28: Full-time, ~40 hrs/week (5 days, Mon–Fri). - Mar 1 – Sept 30: Part-time, ~16 hrs/week (approx. 2 days). Additional details: - Includes a paid lunch break on full-time days. - We value results over hours — if you can hit targets in 5–6 hyper-focused hours/day, that’s fine. - Paid holidays (5): Christmas, New Year’s, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day. - No paid sick leave or PTO (the part-time summer season provides flexibility). - Exclusivity: This role is **exclusively for Headlight Glasses. If you want to juggle multiple clients or side projects, this is not the right role. If you want to go all-in on one product and one mission, you’ll thrive here. --- Profit Share Structure (Capped at 10%) Baseline pre-tax net profit = $254K (average of the last two Oct–Feb swings). - 3% above baseline → up to $500K profit - 5% at $500K profit - 7% at $750K profit - 10% at $1M profit and capped at 10% thereafter The Shared Target: $1M Net Profit Hit $1M pre-tax net profit, and you earn: - $74,600 profit share - +$25,000 milestone bonus - = $99,600 total Past $1M, profit share continues at 10% capped. Payout Examples - Profit = $500K → $7,380 - Profit = $750K → $34,720 - Profit = $1M → $99,600 (profit share + milestone bonus) - Profit = $2M → $199,600 - Profit = $3M → $299,600 (capped at 10%) --- What You’ll Do - Generate **CRO/AOV ideas from scratch** using heatmaps, scroll maps, GA4, pixel data, and AI. - Build & design **custom advertorial-style landing pages** (e.g., “25-step Anti-Glare Coating vs 3-step Headlight Glasses”). - Run A/B and multivariate tests (Shopify native or 3rd-party). - Implement upsells, bundles, and pricing optimizations with autonomy. - Report performance daily during onboarding, then weekly once in rhythm. --- What We’re Looking For - USA-based, regularly drives at night (you understand the customer pain and nuances on American roads). - Proven brand-side CRO success (Shopify or one-product stores). - Direct Response marketing knowledge. - Shopify landing page build + design skills. - Analytics mastery: GA4, Hotjar/Clarity, pixel data, heatmaps. - Experience using AI tools to accelerate CRO. - Hungry, independent executor who thrives on clear metrics. - Believes in the mission (faith-aligned is a plus). - Exclusive focus — you will not work on other clients or projects during employment. --- To Apply Email: james@headlightglasses.com with subject line: “CRO Man” Include: 1. Proof of CRO results (before/after metrics + landing page examples). 2.

100,Product Designer (UI/UX) + Front‑End (Bootstrap/jQuery),"Type: Contract or contract‑to‑hire · Remote · PST‑friendly Reports to: Back‑End Developer + COO Start: Immediate Hours: 20-30 hours weekly for project duration (3 months+) Compensation: $30-60/hr USD About the role We’re rebuilding our internal dashboard on a LAMP stack (PHP views, Bootstrap, jQuery). You’ll be the UX/UI owner who makes it fast, clear, and pleasant to use - then implements the front‑end details yourself in Bootstrap/jQuery and light PHP view edits. You’re as comfortable finding rough edges and breaking things as you are polishing layouts, tables, and forms. What you’ll do Own UI/UX for core dashboard flows: navigation, search/filter, tables, forms, detail views, states (loading/empty/error). Implement UI in Bootstrap 5 + jQuery within PHP templates (light view edits; no heavy backend). “Break it before users do”: run pragmatic QA, fix responsive issues, improve a11y/contrast, tighten microcopy. Partner tightly with backend to scope thin slices, ship quickly, and iterate based on feedback. Establish lightweight patterns (spacing, density, tokens/variables) so the design stays consistent as we grow. What success looks like (first 30–60 days) Many high‑impact UI/UX improvements shipped (keeping in mind time‑to‑task, fewer clicks, reduced support pings). Primary screens refactored with clean Bootstrap utilities; mobile responsiveness feels intentional, with attention to performance and speed as part of the UX. Clear empty, error, and loading states across key flows; obvious actions and safer destructive flows. A short “UI QA checklist” we can reuse on every new feature. You’ll bring 3-6 years designing and building data‑heavy dashboards/tools (not just marketing sites). Fluency with Bootstrap 5 (grid, utilities, theming/variables) and jQuery behaviors/validation. Comfort editing PHP view files/partials to apply classes, extract components, and tidy markup. Strong written and spoken English - crisp specs, concise PRs, clear rationale. Practical AI usage in your everyday workflow, and the way you responsibly supervise its output. Nice to have Figma components/tokens, icon systems, disciplined handoff, and slicing the design into theme-ready, HTML-exportable files. A11y (WCAG 2.2 basics), microcopy craft, internationalization awareness. Basic e2e testing exposure (Playwright/Cypress) or BrowserStack for cross‑browser checks. Version control mastery in team frameworks How we work Friday→Friday sprints, small specs, fast feedback loops. We value clear writing, simple solutions, and measurable outcomes. Slack, Asana, and Google Meet. Location & hours Remote. North American time zones required; Keeping PST hours preferred. Flexibility. Back-end dev works part days, part nights. Ideal that you can keep up with him daily. Compensation Contract or contract‑to‑hire. Please include your hourly rate.

This isn’t the government. You need to be able to learn fast, move fast and handle you need to be able to surviv👨‍🦲 in a scrappy entrepreneur environment.

But data or not, when a decision is made, it is time to get on board. How we are more so as individuals and with each other… Direct – A shitty company is a political company. A political company is one that doesn't communicate directly. Here you can call out anyone. Argue for your ideas. Even against the CEO. Otherwise, we will fail all the while pretending to be nice and not saying what we mean. Just be sure to attack issues and not people. ;) Transparency – Secrets bred politics and resentments. Just being straight up improves team communication and the health of our culture. Solid – We can trust you and you can trust us. You do what you say. And own what you’ve done. Mistakes happen.

Compensation Our pay scale ranges from $85 p/hr to $130 p/hr pending seniority (& team leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full-time weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for going over and above — like training & coaching others, winning new business, speaking at conferences, etc. We prefer long-standing relationships with highly accountable and communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer-term engagements.

We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community. 150% Carbon Negative: Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015.

Strong Morals: Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards.

We fight hard to maintain our focus time. Remote Friendly: Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.

The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role. What will you work on? A production SaaS application used by thousands of customers on a global scale Figuring out the best ways to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers User facing functionalities Maintenance, support and bug fixes of existing functionality What are we looking for?

That means the daily tools of the trade like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.

You are willing and able to travel to Belgium 3 times a year, for our engineering retreats as well as our company Kick-Off If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on zoe.deswaef@silverfin.com. What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners. The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Today, Silverfin is trusted by over 930 accountancy offices across 16 countries. Our clients include all of the Big 4 accounting firms, as well as leading global networks like BDO, PKF, Baker Tilly, Grant Thornton, and Moore. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us!

What does working at Silverfin look like? The Silverfin engineering department consists of seven independent engineering teams. Each team specialises in a part of the Silverfin domain. We are big believers in the effectiveness of  autonomous, cross-functional teams who conduct problem discovery before choosing a solution. All of our teams have dedicated product managers and most of them have dedicated product designers as well. Cross-cutting technical concerns are handled by our two guilds. They consist of members from different teams and work on topics like strategy and architecture, as well as anything related to frontend technologies. Our ops team ensures that things run smoothly, everything scales across our stacks and regions, and will work with you should issues arise. They built our infrastructure to allow for a very high level of developer comfort. Stagings are readily available for every branch, and deployments are safe and dead simple. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”. We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching. For specific needs like AI models and virus scanning we added a couple of satellite services. Everything runs on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice. No code gets deployed without a code review by a peer, and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, with deploys happening dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement. Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: one of our databases exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties APIs of our own. *: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right? What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special? We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40+ people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be. Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday. Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working! We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments. What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. Our team of experienced engineers is there to mentor you and help you hone your craft and improve as an engineer. You will have a chance to get to know and work with a state-of-the-art software development workflow on a real life Rails app at a large scale.. It's also good to know that later on at Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor or as a manager. Everyone gets a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Requirements You have at least 2 years of experience working with Ruby, or 1 year of experience with Ruby and 3 years in one or more other programming languages You have some experience using Javascript framework(s) Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally You are willing and able to travel to Belgium 3 times a year, for our engineering retreats as well as our company Kick-Off Nice to haves These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.
