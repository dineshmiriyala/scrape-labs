Within our first year, we had almost 1,000 customers, $100k in ARR, and a team consisting of our two co-founders, Jack and Pol.

Social Media Manager/Shitposter @ Fun Ecom Co | Great People & Flexible Hours,"<p dir=""ltr"">- Do you have trouble communicating through anything but memes?</p> <p dir=""ltr"">- Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social media addiction?</p> <p dir=""ltr"">- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don&rsquo;t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--Is this a real job ad?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it&rsquo;s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we&rsquo;re big time, people.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we&rsquo;re a pretty big deal):</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/"">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">And check out our reviews on <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=JLS+Trading+Co%20Charlotte,%20NC"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-JLS-Trading-EI_IE1949817.11,22.htm"">Glassdoor</a>, or <a href=""https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Jls-Trading-Co"">Indeed</a> to see that it&rsquo;s not just the founder&rsquo;s mother who says we&rsquo;re cool.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--What do you guys do?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">- Bad Parking Cards (<a href=""https://amz.run/5Eya"">https://amz.run/5Eya</a>)</p> <p dir=""ltr"">- Beverage Barricades (<a href=""https://amz.run/6kip"">https://amz.run/6kip</a>)</p> <p dir=""ltr"">- Child Chucker (<a href=""https://amz.run/9EUz"">https://amz.run/9EUz</a>)</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we&rsquo;re really, really good at PPC)</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it&rsquo;s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--What is your company like?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">1. You Can Be Yourself. You don&rsquo;t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what your credentials are &ndash; it matters what you get done.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don&rsquo;t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we&rsquo;re happy campers.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you&rsquo;re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you&rsquo;re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">6. No Micro-Management. Once you&rsquo;re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren&rsquo;t the place for you.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">8. Supportive Environment. We don&rsquo;t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful &ndash; internal politics are at a minimum here.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">10. We&rsquo;ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You&rsquo;ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We&rsquo;ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What&rsquo;s Right for Us. We don&rsquo;t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--What are your company&rsquo;s values?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">See here: <a href=""http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/"">http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/</a></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it&rsquo;s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you&rsquo;ll learn a lot about us.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--OK, so I&rsquo;ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">No.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--Wait... What?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">OK fiiine.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else you can to create raving fans of our brands (<a href=""https://www.wittyyeti.com/"">Witty Yeti</a> will be your primary project at the start).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are doing now isn&rsquo;t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge and sense of humor to help get there.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">You&rsquo;re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow our social media - we&rsquo;re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation (let&rsquo;s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">You&rsquo;re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The People&trade;. Maybe it&rsquo;s updating our page, maybe it&rsquo;s making some thumbnails (we can teach you), maybe it&rsquo;s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it&rsquo;s crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing you&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">We&rsquo;ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone. We&rsquo;ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--Do I need experience?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I&rsquo;m literally shaking right now.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Also, no you don't need any experience.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">We want special people, and don&rsquo;t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">The Big Bang requirement still stands though.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--Do I need a college degree?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">You just need to be awesome.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--Are there any geographic restrictions?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">As long as you are in a country that doesn&rsquo;t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn&rsquo;t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so&hellip;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--What are your social media accounts?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">This will give you an idea of what we&rsquo;re currently doing:</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com"">https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com</a></p> <p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/"">https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/</a></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--I know a ton about social media but haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;run&rdquo; it before--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what we&rsquo;re doing), then you&rsquo;ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do great.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--This sounds pretty good, though I&rsquo;m still skeptical that this isn&rsquo;t a pyramid scheme.--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">You sound just like the tax authorities!</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">--That doesn&rsquo;t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Once you&rsquo;re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don&rsquo;t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!</p>",https://www.weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jls-trading-co-social-media-manager-shitposter-fun-ecom-co-great-people-flexible,2025-09-05 18:23:14 UTC,2025-10-05 18:23:14 UTC,Sales and Marketing,0,0,USD,JLS Trading Co.,"Charlotte, NC"

If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don&rsquo;t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on zoe.deswaef@silverfin.com.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">What&rsquo;s a Silverfin?</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">At Silverfin we&rsquo;re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we&rsquo;re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">The good news is we&rsquo;re succeeding in doing exactly that. Today, Silverfin is trusted by over 930 accountancy offices across 16 countries. Our clients include all of the Big 4 accounting firms, as well as leading global networks like BDO, PKF, Baker Tilly, Grant Thornton, and Moore. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there&rsquo;s still plenty left to work on, and that&rsquo;s where we hope you come in.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">What does working at Silverfin look like?</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">The Silverfin engineering department consists of seven independent engineering teams. Each team specialises in a part of the Silverfin domain. We are big believers in the effectiveness of&nbsp; autonomous, cross-functional teams who conduct problem discovery before choosing a solution. All of our teams have dedicated product managers and most of them have dedicated product designers as well.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Cross-cutting technical concerns are handled by our two guilds. They consist of members from different teams and work on topics like strategy and architecture, as well as anything related to frontend technologies.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Our ops team ensures that things run smoothly, everything scales across our stacks and regions, and will work with you should issues arise. They built our infrastructure to allow for a very high level of developer comfort. Stagings are readily available for every branch, and deployments are safe and dead simple. We&rsquo;re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the &ldquo;other side&rdquo;.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching. For specific needs like AI models and virus scanning we added a couple of satellite services. Everything runs on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice.&nbsp;</p> <p dir=""ltr"">No code gets deployed without a code review by a peer, and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, with deploys happening dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they&rsquo;re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: one of our databases exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties APIs of our own.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn&rsquo;t that hard to achieve if you&rsquo;re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">We&rsquo;re a remote-first engineering team of 40+ people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they&rsquo;ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that&rsquo;s exactly how it should be.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It&rsquo;s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don&rsquo;t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it&rsquo;s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don&rsquo;t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there&rsquo;s a written, persisted record. We&rsquo;re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack&rsquo;s DnD function, especially when you&rsquo;re not working!</p> <p dir=""ltr"">We&rsquo;d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it&rsquo;s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">What does your future look like?</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">Personal growth is key to staying motivated. Our team of experienced engineers is there to mentor you and help you hone your craft and improve as an engineer. You will have a chance to get to know and work with a state-of-the-art software development workflow on a real life Rails app at a large scale..</p> <p dir=""ltr"">It's also good to know that later on at Silverfin you don&rsquo;t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor or as a manager.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Everyone gets a &euro;1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you&rsquo;ll get paid like any normal day.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">Requirements</h2> <ul> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">You have at least 2 years of experience working with Ruby, or 1 year of experience with Ruby and 3 years in one or more other programming languages</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">You have some experience using Javascript framework(s)</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">You are willing and able to travel to Belgium 3 times a year, for our engineering retreats as well as our company Kick-Off&nbsp;</p> </li> </ul> <h2 dir=""ltr"">Nice to haves</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">These would be nice but are definitely not necessary.

We&rsquo;re united in our goal to help small businesses sell better by eliminating manual work and empowering them to focus on what matters most: relationships.</p> <p>Close sets our compass by our customers and our people. Sustainability is core to serving both; we care deeply about the health of our business and the wellbeing of our team. We&rsquo;re bootstrapped - meaning we&rsquo;ve accepted no outside funding - and fully remote since 2016. The way we&rsquo;ve chosen to build the business allows us to chart our own course.</p> <p>Our team prioritizes impact, ownership, and quality.

CRO Man (Conversion Rate Optimization Specialist),"<p><strong>About Headlight Glasses</strong></p> <p>We&rsquo;re a one-product eCommerce brand built on Direct Response principles, helping American drivers see safely at night. Since launching on October 31st, 2022, we&rsquo;ve generated over $3.4M in profitable revenue &mdash; almost entirely from Meta Ads &mdash; using only a basic Shopify landing page.</p> <p>We are not an unproven startup.

QA Engineer (USA Only - 100% Remote),"<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2> <p>Our app&rsquo;s frontend is a single-page TypeScript web app mostly written in React. Our mobile app is built using React Native. Our UI updates in near real-time and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets, WebRTC, and GraphQL Subscriptions. Our backend <a href=""https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">tech stack</a>&nbsp;consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis, and communicates with clients via our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. We run our services in Docker on AWS.</p> <p>We care about performance, maintainability, and testability of our code. We test with Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, and Chromatic (VRT). Writing tests is embedded into our engineering culture. We also house lists of manual test steps to follow for testing critical features like calling and composing emails. Our focus is on testing actual user behaviour, leveraging the Testing Library approach.</p> <p>Our product development process is inspired by&nbsp;<a href=""https://basecamp.com/shapeup"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Shape Up</a>.
